## How to run the notebook

To run this Jupyter notebook, you will need Caffe and all the dependencies installed on your platform. For more information about on how to install Caffe, please refer below.

I have prepared all the required software for running this notebook on an Amazon Web Services Linux instance (g2.2xlarge). You can access the server from the following link.

In your web browser, access the notebook server using https://54.241.69.198:8888/tree, Your browser will warn that your self-signed certificate is insecure or unrecognized. That’s ok — click past the warnings, and you should get a sign-in page. Type in your password.

I may stop the server to save costs. I will be more than happy to restart the server for your experiments. Please contact me if you need to access the server.


# Caffe

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.
